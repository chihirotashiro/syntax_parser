# syntax_parser
Using your lexical analyzer developed in Project #1 and the parser code provided in class as a guide, develop a recursive descent syntax parser in C or C++ that can validate the syntax of a source code file provided by the user.  Then return the appropriate exit code to inform the Operating System and the grading script how the parse went.
